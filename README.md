## Getting Started

If you want to try Flexagon, it's easy to get started. You can follow the steps to make a functioning webpage with Flexagon (5 minutes).

### 1. Download Flexagon
Put the `flexagon.js` into your folder alongside your HTML file. (The version above is the most up-to-date).

### 2. Put Flexagon into your file
Use the following tag anywhere in the `<head />` section of your document:
```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="flexagon.js"></script>
```

### 3. Create a binder element
A binder is defined like any other HTML element, except it must have at least one page element inside it. Put the following HTML within your `<body />` tag:
```HTML
<binder>
   <page>
      <p>This is intro page.</p>
      <a onclick="openPage('example-page')">Click here to open "example-page!"</a>
   </page>
   <page id="example-page">
      <p>This is example page.</p>
      <a onclick="closeBinder()">Click here to close the binder!</a>
   </page>
</binder>
```

### 4. Style it
You can give a simple design to your binder in the normal way CSS:
```HTML
<style>
   binder {
      background: #fff;
      padding: 10px;
      border: 1px solid #000;
      font-family: sans-serif;
      left: 50%;
   }
</style>
```
Afterwards, you should have a fully functioning example of Flexagon, a dynamic page container which you can manipulate with Javascript.

### 5. Add more functionality
Put the following button anywhere inside your `<binder />` tag:
```HTML
<button onmousedown="userTranslate()">Drag Binder</button>
```
This button will let you click and drag the binder around the screen.

### 6. View the documentation
The above is the most basic demonstration of Flexagon, you can view the [documentation](https://github.com/Jagorak/flexagon/blob/main/documentation.md) if you want to learn more.
